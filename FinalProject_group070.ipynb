    "For our project, we have analyzed Yelp’s open source data to determine whether or not location and population size of the area impacts Yelp ratings. To keep our data consistent, we have compared reviews among the top 10 restaurant chains in the United States. These chains are McDonalds, Starbucks, Subway, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Dunkin’ Donuts, Chick-Fil-A, Domino’s, and Pizza Hut. We have compared Yelp star review ratings within these different chains respectively from zip code locations across the country. In our findings, there was no correlation between location population, density, number of reviews, and the name of the chain and numerical value of Yelp star ratings. We created a predictive linear regression model from the location and review data. This model was not able to make accurate or significant predictions based off of population data. Therefore, we have retained the null hypothesis and concluded that population size and density of the location does not have a significant impact of Yelp ratings."

    "This project was inspired by personal observations. As UCSD students, we noticed a lot of chain restaurants has higher ratings in La Jolla than in their San Diego and surrounding area counterparts. Stranger yet, after sharing our personal recollections of visiting different chain restaurants, we agreed that we hadn’t noticed any substantial differences in service or food quality between chain locations. However, we had noticed cases where a lot of traffic to a restaurant under the same chain resulted in worse service. For example, trying get the Travis Scott meal when the drive-thru at McDonald's was stretching down the street in the highly populated Costa Verde area anecdotally resulted in worse quality food and service compared to getting an equivalent burger on a less crowded day at a different McDonald's in a much less population dense town in New Jersey. This prompted the question - could a restaurant’s location, specifically in relation to population, positively or negatively influence Yelp ratings? \n",
    "\n",
    "We researched what work data scientists have been doing in regards to Yelp, and found some interesting projects. One anonymous Data Science blogger named Ahoulette has created an algorithm to analyze Yelp reviews and predict whether they are positive or negative based off of their text [1]. We found another data project from Stanford where they analyzed users’ previous ratings to predict the numerical star value of their current rating [2]. Most of the current Yelp data projects cover the similar notion of predicting future ratings based off of the text content data from Yelp users’ reviews. Although our project takes a different angle by looking at the outside factor of location, looking at prior work related to Yelp reviews was helpful because our research solidified one important notion: that Yelp reviews are in fact predictable, and are influenced by outside factors other than restaurants’ quality of food and service. \n",

Unfortunately, such a dataset did not exist so we had to find datasets that would help us get close to our ideal dataset target. Our plan was to find Yelp review data and filter it down to the restaurant chains we wanted to look at, find a population dataset that gave us the features we wanted, the merge the two based on Zip Code in order to create a data frame similar in structure to our ideal dataset.\n",

This dataset will provide information on the Yelp reviews based on the location. The reviews from a total of 5,200,000 users, information on 174,000 businesses in 11 metropolitan areas. Since it already counts reviews of the specific number of stars in this dataset there is 209389 entries.\n",

    "The second dataset we will be looking at will be from SimpleMaps where it complies the data of population and population density based off of Zip Code.

    "From our visualizations, we can better understand where our model struggled in predictions. As we can see, one of the main areas where the linear regression failed to come close to an accurate prediction was at higher values. Past a rating of 3.0, the model rarely ended up predicting values greater than 2.7 and lower than 2.2. This meant that in cases where the actual ratings were significantly higher or lower than the top and bottom ends of this range, the model struggled to accurately make predictions. This further shows that population numbers and density along with the restaurant chain and review count are not strong features in predicting Yelp ratings. Further analysis into the suppliers of food and other quality related features could prove to potentially be more effective in predicting the Yelp ratings for a chain restaurant."

    "As seen in our repository, when downloading the Yelp dataset, we are agreeing to Yelp's Dataset Terms of Use. Being able to access the data does not mean it is ethical to use the data. For example, taking into consideration of the dataset and how we performed our linear regression, notice how certain features were not used, such as the address, city, state, longitude, latitude of the particular location of the restaurant was not used. If we used these features mentioned above, it can interfere with the privacy of the Yelp reviewers, which can be seen as unethical. Our project was mainly focused on the restaurants themselves rather than the specifics of the people who gave those restaurants the reviews. This is all very publicized information and is ethical for use in research. It also maintains the privacy of the people who reviewed the chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of the ethics of data is data validity and the accuracy of the data. For our Yelp dataset, we removed instances of where the population and density are null. This infers that if the population is null, then the density will be null as well. By excluding records with missing values such as null values, it can have an impact on our analytical results, and can lead to amplifying bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to think about who is training the model. With the Yelp dataset we used, we were immediately based around 11 metropolitan areas, which could bias the data. In addition, we also used the population data from SimpleMaps. However, we used the free version of this dataset which had data for 10,000 less ZIP codes than the full dataset. This did not have a large impact on the amount of data we used on our final correlation and linear regression analysis, it is still something that we believe should be mentioned."

    "With our research question focusing on the given data from Yelp regarding the chain of restaurants and ratings for each chain, we want to see if we can predict the rating a chain will receive based on geographical and population data. By performing a multiple linear regression, and with the use of our correlation analysis and linear regression analysis, we have concluded that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The features of population and population density, the chain restaurant name, and review count do not have a significant impact on the Yelp rating that was received for that particular fast food chain. Through our findings, this concludes that there is no correlation between the population, population density and the ratings a chain receives. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major limitations to our project was the scope of the Yelp reviews dataset. The Yelp dataset does not entail the entirety of the United States. In fact, a vast portion of the United States is not represented by this dataset. As a result, the data only captures about 11 metropolitan areas which not very representative of the country as a whole. While the results may represent the results of a similar study carried out on the whole country, it must still be noted that the data used in this project, both for Yelp and for population, were severely limited due to the scope of our Yelp dataset.\n",

    "Limitations to our project includes how we took out some null values. There were some missing values in the dataset, and that can limit its usability for the overall model. It would be interesting to look at the scope of our dataset over time, since the population can change over time, and by that we can keep improving and updating our model. In addition, we could not find any information regarding the suppliers for each branch of these chain restaurants. The suppliers of the chains could be indicative of the quality of the food served at these restaurants. Quality can potentially be a better indicator of ratings than population data. It would be insightful to look into that relationship to see if it has any effects on predicting the rating of a chain restaurant.\n",

    "In regards to population, an interesting perspective to look into would be traffic through the zip codes. How many visitors does that town get? How many people pass through it every year? While it would be hard to gather this data, it could be interesting to look into the effects that these statistics have, or if they even have any effects, in relation to the number of stars a chain restaurant receives."
